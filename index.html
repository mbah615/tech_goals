                <p class="intro">My name is John Mbah Yashim. I am a final year student majoring in Computer Science at the American University of Nigeria (AUN), Yola. 
                    I am a dedicated, enthusiastic, and energetic individual that is open minded, eager to learn new things, and aims at adding value wherever I go.
                    As an individual who aspires to grow myself in the tech field.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, I have set certain objectives which I aim to achieve within a two-year span. Personally, I call these fixed objectives my “5-Point Agenda.”
                     They are meant to serve as a guide to keep me focused and committed.
